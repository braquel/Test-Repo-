COURSERA:  Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project

This final course project  was created to meet the course requirement of Getting  and Cleaning course. This project is the culmination of  the four-week long course that  hopefully armed students the knowledge in getting and cleaning data set for various data projects processed through R.  

The project utilized various R commands in subsetting,  merging,  and reshaping  data sets. The project also required renaming variable names with more descriptive forms for more reader-friendly tidy data sets. The final output of the project is the GetTidyData.csv which hopefully  exhibits characteristics that can be described as 'tidy data set'.

Along with the README.md & CodeBook.md,  the repo contains the script file run_analysis.R  to show the various commands utilized in R to run the data set transformations to ultimately generate a final output deemed as a tidy data set. The script contains instructions and recommendations in tidying up multiple often complex data sets.

Source Study 

This project used data sets  from the study "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" [1]  ('study') which measured various activities and related attributes observed from each test participant.  The study revolves around the measurements generated from wearable computing gadgets  while doing daily activities. Further details of the study can be found on the CodeBook.md that accompanies this project
